### Project Description
A revolutionary cat simulator where felines collect fish while battling the ultimate enemy: sleepiness! Switch between three adorable cat characters, each with their own sleeping animations, as you try to stay awake as long as possible in this purrfectly pointless aquatic adventure.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever wondered what happens when cats get too sleepy while fishing? Neither did we! But apparently, there's a critical shortage of games that track how long cats can stay awake while collecting fish underwater. This pressing issue has plagued humanity for... well, since we invented it 5 minutes ago.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've created the world's most sophisticated cat-sleepiness tracking system! Watch your chosen feline friend flip horizontally when moving left (because physics), collect fish for absolutely no reason, and eventually succumb to adorable sleep animations. Features include a completely unnecessary high-score system for wake-time achievements and character switching mid-game because why commit to one cat?

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- **Languages**: GDScript (Godot's native scripting language)
- **Game Engine**: Godot Engine 4.x
- **Graphics**: 2D Sprite Animations, AtlasTexture system for frame extraction
- **Data Storage**: FileAccess API for persistent high-score saving

### Implementation
**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Multi-Character System**: Three unique cat characters with individual sprite sets
- **Sleepiness Mechanics**: Real-time inactivity tracking with visual progress bar
- **High Score Persistence**: Local file storage for tracking longest awake sessions
- **Dynamic Animation Loading**: Runtime sprite frame extraction from texture atlases
- **In-Game Character Switching**: Seamless character swapping during gameplay
